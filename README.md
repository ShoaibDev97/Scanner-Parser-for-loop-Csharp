**ForLoop Parser and Scanner in C#**

Overview
This C# project provides an implementation of a scanner (lexer) and parser designed specifically for parsing for loop constructs in a simplified programming language. The scanner tokenizes the input source code into meaningful tokens, while the parser processes these tokens to ensure correct syntax and constructs a representation of the for loop.

Features
Scanner: Tokenizes input code into elements such as keywords (for), identifiers, literals, operators, and delimiters.
Parser: Analyzes the sequence of tokens to validate the syntax of for loops and builds a structured representation.
